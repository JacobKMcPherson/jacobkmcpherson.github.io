# Streamlining Your Content Workflow

As a researcher and content creator, I've always looked for ways to streamline my publishing workflow. Today, I'm excited to share how I automated the process of cross-posting my Quarto blog posts to Medium using GitHub Actions and the Medium API.

## Why Automate Cross-Posting?

Writing quality content takes time, but manually cross-posting to different platforms can be tedious and error-prone. By automating this process, I can:

- **Save time**: Write once, publish everywhere automatically
- **Maintain consistency**: Ensure all platforms have the latest content
- **Reduce errors**: No more copy-paste mistakes or forgotten publications
- **Focus on writing**: Spend more time creating content, less time managing it

## The Technical Solution

The solution I developed uses:

1. **Quarto** for writing and generating the blog
2. **Medium API** for programmatic publishing
3. **GitHub Actions** for automation
4. **Python** for the integration script

### Key Features

- **Smart duplicate detection**: Only publishes new or updated posts
- **Automatic tag conversion**: Converts Quarto categories to Medium tags
- **Image path fixing**: Converts relative paths to absolute GitHub URLs
- **Error handling**: Won't break your site if Medium is down

## How It Works

When I push a new blog post to my repository:

1. GitHub Actions triggers the workflow
2. Quarto builds the website as usual
3. The Medium publisher script scans for new/updated `.qmd` files
4. It converts the content to Medium-compatible format
5. Posts are published to Medium via their API
6. A record is kept to avoid republishing

## Getting Started

Setting up this automation for your own blog is straightforward:

1. Get a Medium integration token from your settings
2. Add it as a GitHub secret
3. Include the publisher script in your repository
4. Update your GitHub Actions workflow

The entire setup takes about 15 minutes and will save you hours in the long run.

## Results

Since implementing this automation, my content workflow has become much more efficient. I can focus entirely on writing quality posts, knowing they'll automatically reach my audience on both my personal site and Medium.

## What's Next?

I'm considering expanding this to other platforms like Dev.to and Hashnode. The modular design makes it easy to add new publishing destinations.
