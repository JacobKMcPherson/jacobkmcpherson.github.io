### Adventure & Purpose is my journey
through the past, present, and future of human ingenuity—where curiosity drives discovery and purpose guides progress. This series reflects on how science, technology, engineering, and medicine have shaped our world, and how today’s breakthroughs lay the foundation for a better tomorrow.

🔬

### I will build on this legacy
by exploring the intersections of discovery, design, and human impact — connecting past breakthroughs to emerging frontiers. These stories rooted in the deep past will flow like a river that starts upon a mountain as only a trickle — moments when early insights, bold risks, or quiet innovations changed the trajectory of human progress — and narratives that imagine the possibilities ahead. By pairing historical turning points with forward-looking visions, I aim to show how the threads of discovery stretch across time, connecting where we’ve been with where we might go next.

🧬

### I will document my experiences:
at today’s leading scientific and medical conferences, where scientists, doctors, and innovators gather to share breakthrough discoveries. By capturing these moments firsthand—new therapies, bold ideas, and the people driving them forward—I hope to illuminate the living, evolving landscape of modern science as it unfolds in real time.
